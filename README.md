# odin-recipes

This is a simple website assignment from The Odin Project meant to task users with learning and practicing HTML. I am doing this project to learn web development and HTML, as I have no experience in either.

The point of the website is to provide links to many recipes. Once the link is clicked, it brings you to the recipe's own webpage where it provides an image of the finished dish, ingredients required to make it, and steps on how to make the dish. The website is very simple and The Odin Project makes it clear that it does not need to be flashy, it is just for practice. Making this website is a foundation for me to make much more impressive web development stuff in the future.
